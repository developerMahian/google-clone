<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

Eager to build a Google React App by taking inspiration from this repository? Well follow through the steps. Stay patient, work hard enough and you'll reach the end successfully. You can take the project from here to a totally different direction of your own if you want to by adding different functionalities if you want to.

### Prerequisites

You must have these requirements filled before moving on to building this project on your local machine.

- Node JS
- npm or yarn or pnpm
- Google-Search, Google-Image-Search and Bing-Video-Search Api access keys at [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/) for free

### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can follow through this repository and build your own CryptoNews App and hopefully add a different flavour to it_

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/developerMahian/google-clone.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages with npm or yarn or pnpm
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Rename the .env.example as .env and set your own API keys
   ```js
   API_KEY = "ENTER YOUR API";
   ```
